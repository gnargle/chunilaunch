# chunilaunch
An app to make it easier to launch things.

![A screenshot of the application!](/screen.png)

Place the exe in the same folder as your segatools ini. Run it, pick the location of your start batch for the game, start batch for local server, and where you want/where your combined launcher batch file currently is.

Then enter settings for both local and remote as appropriate.

Select a server at the bottom and optionally toggle windowed mode, and launch.

This software is provided as is. It is well tested on my own setup but can and will break your install if you put the wrong things in on purpose.
